# AirBnB Clone - Web Static

## Background Context

In the realm of web development, the AirBnB clone project focuses on bringing static web pages to life. This step-by-step front-end development aims to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface for managing AirBnB objects.

## Project Objectives

- Design, sketch, and prototype each element.
- Create simple HTML static pages.
- Develop a style guide for consistent design.
- Incorporate fake contents for visualization.
- Exclude Javascript and avoid loading data from external sources.

## Learning Focus

Throughout the project, emphasis is placed on mastering HTML and CSS languages. HTML serves as the structural foundation of the web pages, while CSS defines the visual design. It is recommended to prioritize fixing HTML structure before delving into styling, as structure is a prerequisite for effective design implementation.
